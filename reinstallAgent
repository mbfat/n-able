        C:\Program Files (x86)\Take Control Agent_<#INSTANCE_NAME#>
    Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Advanced Monitoring Agent\featureres and delete the following files:

        MSP_Connect.exe
    Open the registry and delete the following key:

    Open the RMM Dashboard

        If remote Background feature was previously disabled, re-enable it again.

    Wait a few moments for the remote commands to begin the installation.
    Ensure you do not have any endpoint content filtering solution or AV blocking any Take Control (N-able) processes.
